    long_description="""Giws is basically doing the same stuff as SWIG but the opposite.
 Calling Java from C/C++ can be tricky: JNI calls are complicated
 especially when dealing with non primivite types or arrays,
 performance issues must be kept in mind all the time,
 the code can be redundant (checking exceptions, checking returns
 of operations...).
 Giws hides this complexity through a C++ class which wraps the
 Java class."""
